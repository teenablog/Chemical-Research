<h1>Global Fluralaner Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p><strong>The global Fluralaner market is poised for significant expansion</strong>, with projections indicating growth from <strong>USD 280 million in 2023 to USD 450 million by 2030</strong>, advancing at a robust <strong>CAGR of 7.1% during the forecast period (2024-2030)</strong>. This growth trajectory underscores Fluralaner's rising prominence as a key active pharmaceutical ingredient in veterinary medicines and insecticides worldwide.</p><p><strong>1. Rising Companion Animal Ownership &amp; Parasite Prevalence:</strong><br>
With <strong>67% of U.S. households owning pets</strong> and global companion animal populations exceeding 1 billion, demand for ectoparasite treatments has surged. Fluralaner's <strong>12-week protection cycle</strong> and <strong>98% flea/tick eradication rate</strong> position it as a preferred active ingredient in veterinary formulations.</p><p><strong>2. Stringent Food Safety Regulations:</strong><br>
The global push for <strong>antibiotic-free livestock production</strong> has intensified focus on parasiticides. Fluralaner-based products meet stringent FDA/EMA residue limits, with withdrawal periods <strong>40% shorter</strong> than traditional treatments - a critical factor for meat and dairy producers.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
