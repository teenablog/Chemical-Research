<h1>Sodium-22 Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><p>The global <strong>Sodium-22 market</strong> is projected to experience steady expansion from <strong>2024 to 2030</strong>, driven by persistent industrial demand and radioactive tracer applications. While this beta-emitting radioisotope represents a niche segment in nuclear medicine and industrial sectors, its indispensable role in positron emission tomography (PET) calibration and oil well logging continues to fuel market progression. Recent geopolitical disruptions have highlighted supply chain vulnerabilities, prompting reevaluation of domestic production capabilities across major economies.</p><p><strong>1. Expanding Diagnostic Imaging Infrastructure:</strong><br>
The global PET scanner installed base surpassed <strong>6,500 units in 2023</strong>, creating sustained demand for Sodium-22 calibration standards. With PET-CT acquisitions growing at <strong>8-10% annually</strong> in emerging medical markets, radiopharmaceutical quality control requirements are driving consistent uptake.</p><p><strong>2. Industrial Process Monitoring Applications:</strong><br>
Downhole logging tools utilizing Sodium-22's gamma emissions accounted for <strong>23% of radioactive tracer use in oilfields</strong> last year. The resurgence of E&amp;P activities has increased demand, particularly in unconventional reservoirs where the isotope's <strong>2.6-year half-life</strong> proves advantageous for long-term reservoir characterization.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
