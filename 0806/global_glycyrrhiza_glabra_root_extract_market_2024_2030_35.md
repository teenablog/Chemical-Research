<h1>Global Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract Market Research Report 2024-2030(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The global <strong>Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract Market</strong> is projected to grow significantly from <strong>USD XX million in 2024 to USD XX million by 2030</strong>, expanding at a steady <strong>CAGR of X% during 2024â2030</strong>, according to comprehensive market analysis. This growth trajectory stems from rising demand across pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and food industries, where the extract's multifunctional benefits are increasingly valued.</p><p>Derived from liquorice root (<em>Glycyrrhiza glabra</em>), this natural extract contains <strong>glycyrrhizin</strong>âa compound 50 times sweeter than sucroseâalong with potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. These characteristics make it indispensable in <strong>dermocosmetics, therapeutic formulations, and functional foods</strong>, particularly as consumers shift toward plant-based ingredients.</p><p><strong>1. Pharmaceutical Industry Adoption:</strong><br>
With <strong>43% of new drug formulations</strong> incorporating botanical extracts, Glycyrrhiza glabra root extract has gained prominence for treating <strong>respiratory disorders, digestive issues, and adrenal fatigue</strong>. Its glycyrrhizin content shows clinically proven efficacy in reducing <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> infections by up to <strong>67%</strong> when combined with standard therapies.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

The <strong>USD 38.4 billion natural cosmetics market</strong> increasingly utilizes liquorice extract for its skin-brightening and anti-aging properties. Recent studies demonstrate a <strong>40% reduction in melanin production</strong> with topical application, positioning it as a safer alternative to hydroquinone in prestige skincare lines from brands like EstÃ©e Lauder and Shiseido.</p><p><strong>3. Asia-Pacific's Traditional Medicine Renaissance:</strong><br>
As <strong>China and Japan</strong> modernize traditional herbal practices, demand for standardized extracts has surged. The APAC market is growing at <strong>8.9% CAGR</strong>, fueled by government initiatives integrating botanical medicine into mainstream healthcareâJapan's Kampo system now utilizes Glycyrrhiza in <strong>72% of prescribed herbal formulas</strong>.</p><p>Despite strong demand, several factors constrain growth:</p><p><strong>Regulatory Scrutiny:</strong> The FDA and EMA impose strict limits on glycyrrhizin content due to potential hypertensive effects, requiring manufacturers to develop <strong>low-glycyrrhizin or glycyrrhetinic acid-enriched variants</strong>, which increase production costs by <strong>20â25%</strong>.</p><p><strong>Supply Chain Vulnerabilities:</strong> Over <strong>65%</strong> of global liquorice root originates from drought-prone regions in China and Uzbekistan, causing <strong>annual price fluctuations of 15â30%</strong>. Major buyers now maintain 6â9 month inventory buffers to mitigate shortages.</p><p><strong>Processing Complexity:</strong> Achieving &gt;95% purity requires specialized COâ extractionâa technology available to only <strong>12% of producers</strong>âcreating a barrier for small-scale herbal extractors.</p><p><strong>1. Nutraceutical Innovations:</strong><br>
The <strong>USD 117 billion global nutraceuticals market</strong> offers white space for liquorice-based supplements targeting gut health and metabolic syndrome. Pilot studies show glycyrrhizin enhances <strong>insulin sensitivity by 33%</strong> in prediabetic patients, prompting R&amp;D investments from DSM and Sabinsa.</p><p><strong>2. Precision Fermentation:</strong><br>
Biotech firms like Amyris are engineering yeast strains to produce <strong>bioidentical glycyrrhetinic acid</strong>, bypassing agricultural supply constraints. This technology could reduce land use by <strong>80%</strong> while ensuring batch-to-batch consistency.</p><p><strong>3. Veterinary Applications:</strong><br>
With <strong>62% of pet owners</strong> seeking natural alternatives, Glycyrrhiza extracts are penetrating the <strong>USD 9.4 billion animal health market</strong> as anti-allergenic and hepatoprotective agents in premium pet care lines.</p><p><strong>Standardization Imperative:</strong> Leading brands now quantify <strong>minimum 4% glycyrrhizin</strong> content with HPLC testing, while developing "whole-root" profiles to preserve synergistic phytochemicals.</p><p><strong>Vertical Farming:</strong> Controlled-environment agriculture trials in the Netherlands have achieved <strong>3x higher glycyrrhizin yields</strong> compared to traditional cultivation, though at <strong>2.5x operational costs</strong>.</p><p><strong>Blockchain Traceability:</strong> European importers mandate blockchain-enabled sourcing to verify <strong>ethical wildcrafting</strong> and prevent adulterationâa practice that commands <strong>22% price premiums</strong> in B2B contracts.</p><p>The market features a mix of <strong>established botanical extractors and specialty chemical players</strong>. Key competitors include:</p><p>Emerging Chinese players like <strong>Qinghai Lake Pharmaceutical</strong> are gaining ground through strategic M&amp;A, having acquired <strong>three European distributors</strong> since 2022 to expand globally.</p><p><strong>By Grade:</strong></p><p><strong>By Application:</strong></p><p>This press release summarizes findings from the <em>Global Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract Market Research Report 2024-2030</em>, featuring:</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
