<h1>ARA Raw Material for Milk Powder Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><p>The global <strong>ARA Raw Material for Milk Powder market</strong> is projected to experience steady growth from <strong>2024 to 2030</strong>, driven by increasing demand for fortified infant nutrition products worldwide. ARA (arachidonic acid), an essential omega-6 fatty acid, plays a critical role in infant brain development and visual function, making it a vital ingredient in modern infant formula formulations.</p><p><strong>1. Rising Infant Formula Demand:</strong><br>
With global birth rates stabilizing and disposable incomes increasing, particularly in emerging markets, premium infant nutrition products are gaining traction. The infant formula market, growing at approximately <strong>6% annually</strong>, continues to drive ARA demand as manufacturers seek to mirror breast milk's nutritional profile.</p><p><strong>2. Regulatory Changes:</strong><br>
China's updated national standards for milk powder, effective March 2024, have increased the allowable limits for DHA and ARA content â a move that's expected to stimulate formulation adjustments across the industry. The revised standards reflect growing recognition of these nutrients' importance in early childhood development.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
