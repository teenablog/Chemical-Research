<h1>Global Aerospace Composite Materials Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p><strong>The global aerospace composite materials market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>USD 5.50 billion in 2023 to USD 7.76 billion by 2029</strong>, registering a steady <strong>CAGR of 5.90%</strong> during the forecast period, according to latest industry analysis. This expansion is fueled by escalating demand for <strong>lightweight, fuel-efficient aircraft components</strong> and the aerospace industry's growing emphasis on <strong>advanced material solutions.</strong></p><p>Aerospace composites—engineered materials combining fibers and resins—have become indispensable in modern aviation, offering <strong>exceptional strength-to-weight ratios, corrosion resistance, and design flexibility</strong>. These characteristics make them particularly valuable for <strong>next-generation aircraft manufacturing, satellite components, and military aviation applications.</strong></p><p><strong>1. Surging Commercial Aviation Demand:</strong><br>
The commercial aircraft sector accounts for <strong>62% of composite material usage</strong> in aerospace, driven by new-generation aircraft like Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350, which incorporate <strong>50-53% composite materials by weight</strong>. Airbus reported a backlog of 8,600 aircraft orders as of 2023, indicating sustained demand.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

Global defense spending reached <strong>USD 2.24 trillion in 2023</strong>, with major powers investing in composite-intensive platforms. The F-35 Lightning II program alone will require <strong>1,700+ aircraft through 2035</strong>, each containing approximately <strong>35% composite materials</strong> by weight.</p><p><strong>3. Space Sector Expansion:</strong><br>
With the global space economy projected to reach <strong>USD 1 trillion by 2040</strong>, composites are increasingly used in satellite structures and launch vehicles. SpaceX's Starlink program plans to deploy <strong>12,000+ satellites</strong> by 2027, all utilizing advanced composite components.</p><p>While promising, the industry faces significant obstacles:</p><p><strong>High Production Costs:</strong> Advanced composite manufacturing requires <strong>40-60% higher capital expenditure</strong> compared to traditional metal fabrication, with autoclave curing processes accounting for <strong>up to 30%</strong> of total part costs.</p><p><strong>Complex Certification Processes:</strong> FAA and EASA certification for new composite applications can take <strong>3-5 years</strong>, delaying time-to-market and increasing R&amp;D budgets by <strong>25-40%</strong> for manufacturers.</p><p><strong>Recycling Difficulties:</strong> Only <strong>15-20%</strong> of aerospace composites are currently recycled, with the industry facing growing pressure to develop economically viable recycling solutions amid stricter environmental regulations.</p><p><strong>1. Out-of-Autoclave Technologies:</strong><br>
Next-generation manufacturing methods like <strong>resin transfer molding</strong> and <strong>automated fiber placement</strong> can reduce production costs by <strong>30-35%</strong> while maintaining structural integrity, making composites more accessible for smaller aircraft programs.</p><p><strong>2. Sustainable Material Development:</strong><br>
Bio-based resins and recycled carbon fibers are gaining traction, with Airbus targeting <strong>100% sustainable material usage</strong> by 2035. The market for eco-composites in aerospace is expected to grow at <strong>12.8% CAGR</strong> through 2030.</p><p><strong>3. Urban Air Mobility:</strong><br>
The burgeoning eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) sector, projected to reach <strong>USD 30 billion by 2030</strong>, represents a new frontier for lightweight composite applications in airframe and propulsion systems.</p><p><strong>Digital Manufacturing:</strong> <br>
    Industry 4.0 technologies like <strong>AI-driven predictive maintenance</strong> and <strong>digital twin simulations</strong> are reducing composite part defects by up to <strong>45%</strong> while improving production efficiency.</p><p><strong>Hybrid Material Systems:</strong><br>
    Combining composites with <strong>additively manufactured metallic components</strong> allows for optimized structures, with Boeing reporting <strong>20-25% weight savings</strong> in recent demonstrator programs.</p><p><strong>Supply Chain Regionalization:</strong><br>
    Geopolitical tensions are prompting manufacturers to establish <strong>localized production hubs</strong>, with composites suppliers increasingly setting up facilities near final assembly plants to reduce logistics costs.</p><p>The market features a mix of established material scientists and aerospace specialists. <strong>Toray Industries</strong> and <strong>Hexcel</strong> collectively command <strong>38% market share</strong> in carbon fiber composites, while <strong>Solvay</strong> leads in advanced resin systems.</p><p>Emerging players like <strong>Renegade Materials</strong> are gaining traction with <strong>high-temperature composites</strong> for engine applications, while traditional suppliers are expanding through strategic acquisitions - exemplified by <strong>Teijin's purchase of Renegade Materials</strong> in 2022.</p><p><strong>By Material Type:</strong></p><p><strong>By Application:</strong></p><p><strong>By Aircraft Type:</strong></p><p>This press release highlights findings from the <em>Global Aerospace Composite Materials Market Research Report 2024 (Status and Outlook)</em>.
