<h1>Global 1-Bromopropane Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The global <strong>1-Bromopropane Market</strong>, valued at <strong>USD 247.74 million in 2023</strong>, is projected to grow steadily to <strong>USD 282.29 million by 2029</strong>, registering a <strong>CAGR of 2.20% during the forecast period</strong>. Also known as n-Propyl Bromide (nPB), this versatile solvent has gained significant traction across multiple industries due to its excellent cleaning properties, fast evaporation rate, and environmental advantages over traditional chlorinated solvents.</p><p><strong>1. Tightening Environmental Regulations:</strong><br>
With increasing global restrictions on ozone-depleting substances and hazardous air pollutants, 1-Bromopropane has emerged as a cleaner alternative to perc (perchloroethylene) and TCE (trichloroethylene) in precision cleaning and adhesive applications. The US EPAÃ¢s SNAP program listing it as an acceptable substitute has accelerated adoption, particularly in North American manufacturing sectors.</p><p><strong>2. Expanding Electronics Manufacturing Sector:</strong><br>
The booming electronics industry, growing at <strong>6.8% annually</strong>, relies heavily on 1-Bromopropane for degreasing and flux removal in PCB assembly. Its ability to clean without leaving residues makes it indispensable for high-precision components, with Asia-Pacific accounting for <strong>72% of global electronics production demand</strong>.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
